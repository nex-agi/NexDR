  Deep Research Continuation Tool
  
  This tool is used internally by the deep research finish judge hook to provide system reminders
  when the research process needs to continue or when it ends unexpectedly without proper completion.
  
  The tool returns formatted system reminder messages to guide the agent towards proper completion
  of the research task, specifically emphasizing the need to use the ReportWrite tool for final output.
  
  This tool requires no input parameters and automatically generates the appropriate system reminder.
